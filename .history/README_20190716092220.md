Here you will find a semaphore. You don't have to style it, but if you want to change something you are welcome.

## What you need to do?
When user clicks on semaphore, should happen 2 things:
1. Color will change to the next (red -> yellow, yellow -> green, green -> red);
2. Text under the semaphore should also change, based on color (`STOP!`, `Wait!`, `GO!`);
